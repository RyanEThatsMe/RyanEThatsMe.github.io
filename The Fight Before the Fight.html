<p>This fight started with no bad blood. Both just wanted to do a fight. Joe was the far favorite to win<br/>
    but KSI was persistent about fight and wanted to make this fight happen. Both personel had four months to train.<br/>
    The fight was scheduled for early february 2018. They did all the press conferences like the professionals do <br/>
    and the beef began. These two started to have bad blood during these and now they actually want to kill each other.</p>
