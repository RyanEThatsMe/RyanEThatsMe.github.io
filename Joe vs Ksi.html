    <p>KSI is a youtube located in england. He has 18 million subscribers currently on his channel.<br/>
        He's also not know for fighting. KSI is know on youtube for his outrageous skits and for playing fifa.<br/>
        KSI's personailty has carried him to where he is today and is one of the reasons that this fight is <bold>THE GREATEST AMATURE FIGHT EVER.</bold></p>

    <p>Joe is also a youtuber however he is slightly less popular. Joe sits at almost 5 million subscribers.<br/>
        Joe was inspired by KSI to make videos. He even copied how he talked and looked at some points. <br/>
        Joe is also a community figure that started, much like KSI, with fifa and skits.</p>

</div>
<p>This fight started with no bad blood. Both just wanted to do a fight. Joe was the far favorite to win<br/>
    but KSI was persistent about fight and wanted to make this fight happen. Both personel had four months to train.<br/>
    The fight was scheduled for early february 2018. They did all the press conferences like the professionals do <br/>
    and the beef began. These two started to have bad blood during these and now they actually want to kill each other.</p>

         <p>This fight was very impressive for people who had little to no fighting experience before hand. In only four <br/>
        They were able to pull of this huge venue and put on a show for 25 million people. It's incredible. I wont say to<br/>
        much about the fight because you'll have to watch it by clicking the link at the top of the page, but it is <br/>
        definitely worth a watch. You could feel the tension from the moment they step into the ring. At some points <br/>
        in the fight you can tell that they want to hurt each other as well. They were friends once but now they have<br/>
        turned into enemies . It was a great thing to experience and was a surreal part for both joe and Ksi.</p>
