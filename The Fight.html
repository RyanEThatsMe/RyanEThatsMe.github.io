<p>This fight was very impressive for people who had little to no fighting experience before hand. In only four <br/>
    They were able to pull of this huge venue and put on a show for 25 million people. It's incredible. I wont say to<br/>
    much about the fight because you'll have to watch it by clicking the link at the top of the page, but it is <br/>
    definitely worth a watch. You could feel the tension from the moment they step into the ring. At some points <br/>
    in the fight you can tell that they want to hurt each other as well. They were friends once but now they have<br/>
    turned into enemies . It was a great thing to experience and was a surreal part for both joe and Ksi.</p>
